2016 is near, and like any new years it comes with taking new resolutions. 
<!--more-->
This year I decided to :

* be more organised
* make and participate in exciting projects.

I have always wanted to make a blog. But since I'm a huge *procrastinator* I knew that after a few days, I wouldn't post anything anymore. 

So, for those who know me, you're surely wondering where I found the motivation to start this blog... 

Well, I'm still not motivated, but I decided to follow the advices of one guy from this [old reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af).

So yes **no more zero days**. And the best way I found to monitor my progression is by starting a blog where I will share my work and thoughts.

Since I already owned a domain name and with [github](https://pages.github.com/) offering free hosting (yeahhh !!!), I went through [jekyll's docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) and in one day (ok you got me, two days), everything was set. It was easier than I thought. I started with [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) a Jekyll theme based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) and customize it to fit my needs. I added a footer, a comment system (Google+ comments), a *fancy* picture of me in the sidebar and a [favicon](/public/avatar.png) made with gimp (the N is for Noutahi if you didn't guess).

In the following days I will probably add a post on how I did everything and every source I used. 

I can't promise that this blog will be regularly updated, but I will do my best...

Merry christmas and happy new year to all !!
