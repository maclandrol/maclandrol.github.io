Hello there ! I'm a PhD student in genome evolution at [Nadia El-Mabrouk's lab](http://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~mabrouk/).

I’m interested in anything related to bioinformatics, genomics, high-tech and artificial intelligence. You can <a href="/public/assets/CV.pdf">find my resume here</a>.

I love hacking things to fit my needs. So I thought maybe I should share it with other people.

I'm open for collaboration on any exciting project. Follow me on [github](http://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}).
