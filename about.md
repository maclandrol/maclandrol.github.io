title: About me
---

Hello there ! I'm a PhD student in genome evolution at [Nadia El-Mabrouk's lab](http://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~mabrouk/)

Iâ€™m interested in anything related to bioinformatics, genomics, high-tech and artificial intelligence. You can find my resume (fr) [here](/public/assets/CV.pdf)

I love open source and also hacking thing to make them work for me. So I thought maybe I should share it with other people.

I'm open for collaboration on any project. Follow me on github and twitter!
