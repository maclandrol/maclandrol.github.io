title: About me
---

Hello there ! I'm a PhD student in genome evolution at [Nadia El-Mabrouk's lab](http://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~mabrouk/).

Iâ€™m interested in anything related to bioinformatics, genomics, high-tech and artificial intelligence. You can find my resume [here (fr)](/public/assets/CV.pdf).

I love hacking things to fit my needs. So I thought maybe I should share it with other people.

I'm open for collaboration on any exciting project. Follow me on [github](http://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}).

For a list of my publication, see my [google scholar page](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=JcuwpbQAAAAJ)
